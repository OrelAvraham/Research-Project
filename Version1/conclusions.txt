Data:
The nietzsche data was not very organized.
It was built from lost of nietzsche short stories and sayings h=what led the machine learn large amount of sentences
that are not really related like ends of sayings combined with starts of completely other stories.

One solution is try organize the data in a better way and slicing it so there won't be bad sentences to learn from.
Another solution is using other dataset like one long text like a play.

Model:
There wasn't really a problem we so, the model worked pretty ok, adding a dense layer may make it learn deeper, maybe
later even another rnn layer.
